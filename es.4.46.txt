'Lets look at parse-noun-phrase and parse-prepositional-phrase:
(define (parse-prepositional-phrase)
 (list 'prep-phrase
  (parse-word prepositions)
  (parse-noun-phrase)))

(define (parse-noun-phrase)
 (define (maybe-extend noun-phrase)
  (amb noun-phrase
   (maybe-extend (list 'noun-phrase
                  noun-phrase
                  (parse-prepositional-phrase)))))
 (maybe-extend (parse-simple-noun-phrase)))

It seems that is we evaluate the complex case first (right to left for example), there will be some changes to the *unparsed global variable that makes us lose possibilities when we backtrack (not clear to me if the rest of the variables outside of amb are restored).
