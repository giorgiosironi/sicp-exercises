She's right, par2 has better precision in the center for example:

1 ]=> (center (par1 r1 r2))
;Value: 50.02000200020002

1 ]=> (center (par2 r1 r2))
;Value: 50.

And also in bounds:

1 ]=> (lower-bound (par1 r1 r2))
;Value: 48.51980198019802

1 ]=> (lower-bound (par2 r1 r2))
;Value: 49.49999999999999

Since we do fewer operations and each operation introduces errors, we have a result with less absolute/relative errors.
