The order does not affect the result:

1 ]=> (cc 100 us-coins)
;Value: 292

1 ]=> (cc 100 out-of-order-us-coins)
;Value: 292

To explore other currencies we remove the head of the list and recur into the rest, so the order does not matter anymore as we get the full space of combinations.
Previously order matter because we could only keep track of *which* kind-of-coins were left with a number, which told us only *how many* kind-of-coins were left; to translate that into a conceptual list of kind-of-coins we need to assume an order.
