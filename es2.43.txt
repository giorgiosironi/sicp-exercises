  (lambda (new-row)
    (map (lambda (rest-of-queens)
           (adjoin-position new-row k rest-of-queens))
         (queen-cols (- k 1))))
(enumerate-interval 1 board-size))

For each of the new-rows at level k, this program generates queen-cols for level k-1; the original generated all new-rows at level k for each of the queen-cols solutions for level k-1.

Therefore the problem of level k has to solve n times the k-1 problem, growing exponentially with n. Assuming the original program grows with inferior complexity, T becomes n^n*T.
