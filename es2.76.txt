Generic operations with explicit dispatch:
- modifying all existing procedures adding a new clause for a new data type
- new operation implementations to tie together in a generic one for new operations

Data-directed style:
- new calls to 'put to install the primitives for new data types
- new operation implementation and their 'put installation for new operations

Message-passing style:
- creating a new isolated function for new data types
- new operation implementations in all existing types for new operations

The first two systems are better suited to add new operations, while message-passing style to add new data types.
