(magnitude z)
z has the 'complex tag

So apply-generic is invoked:
(apply-generic 'magnitude z)

It performs (get 'magnitude '(complex)) which returns the magnitude function for the complex module.

(magnitude z)
is called and z has the 'rectangular tag

So apply-generic is invoked
(apply-generic 'magnitude 'rectangular z)

It performs (get 'magnitude '(rectangular)) which returns the magnitude function for the complex-rectangular module.

(magnitude z) now returns the (sqrt (...)) implementation.
