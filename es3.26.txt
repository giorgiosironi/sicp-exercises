The list (cdr table) must be substituted by a tree of records.
Each record is still (cons key value).
The records can be ordered by their keys.
(assoc key records) needs to check whether:
- the current branch contains key
- key is higher than the key of current branch, then recurring into the left branch
- key is lower than the key of current branch, then recurring into the right branch
If assoc reaches a null? value, the record is declared not found.

insert! should use the insertion mechanism of the tree after lookup having found nothing. If lookup finds something, cdr-set! can still be used to change the value of the record.
