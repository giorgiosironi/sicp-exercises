A: r_x, r_x, w_x
B: r_x, r_x, r_x, w_x

1000000 (B runs exactly after A has finished)
100000 (if B gets an old value of X in one place)
10000 (if B gets an old value of X in one place)
1000 (if B gets an old value of X in three places)
100 (lost update of B)

Other cases should still be covered by these values.

If we serialize, the only possible result is 1000000 no matter the order in which the procedures are executed.
