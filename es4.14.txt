Not very clear what code we are executing or what is the input, since the eval implementation is scattered throughout the chapter.
I've found this explation of why Louis approach does not work:

It seems that using the primitive map, we will pass '(primitive ...) which cannot be passed to it as it's not applicable to any argument. Everytime we have higher-order functions like map we cannot define them as just the primitives of the underlying Scheme as they will be passed tagged lists instead of something that can be applied.
