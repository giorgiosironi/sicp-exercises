This procedure does not terminate:
(define (run-forever) (run-forever))

(define (try p)
  (if (halts? p p)
      (run-forever)
      'halted))

Let's evalute (try try).

Case 1: it halts

If (try try) halts, it means it's returning 'halted, which means the if condition is false. So (halts? try try) is false, which is a contradiction.

Case 2: it does not halt

If (try try) does not halt, it means it cannot return 'halted, which means the if condition must be true. So (halts? try try is true, which is a contradiction.
