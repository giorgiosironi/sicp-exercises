- For example, consider the common case (typical of procedure bodies) where the sequence has just one expression.  What work will the execution procedure produced by Alyssa's program do?
It will perform analysis of the one expression that composes the procedure, and then execute it.

- What about the execution procedure produced by the program in the text above?
The one expression is analyzed at analysis time as you would expect.

- How do the two versions compare for a sequence with two expressions?
In the text version, analyze is mapped over all the expressions, so all the expressions in the sequence are actually analyzed at analysis time. All of them are a analyzed at execution time for Alyssa's version.

Looking around in other solutions, I also saw that the overhead of sequencing (building a structure of lambdas in the 'sequentially procedure) is moved at analysis time in the text version.
