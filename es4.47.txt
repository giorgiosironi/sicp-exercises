Before:
(define (parse-verb-phrase)
 (define (maybe-extend verb-phrase)
  (amb verb-phrase
       (maybe-extend (list 'verb-phrase
                           verb-phrase
                           (parse-prepositional-phrase)))))
 (maybe-extend (parse-word verbs)))
Proposed change:
(define (parse-verb-phrase)
 (amb (parse-word verbs)
      (list 'verb-phrase
            (parse-verb-phrase)
            (parse-prepositional-phrase))))
This doesn't work, I think, because (parse-word) is destructive and cannot be put inside amb in this way.
The first case of amb would succeed, parsing (verb lectures), but then (parse-verb-phrase) in the second case would not find any remaining verb in the input and will fail.
If we interchange the order of expressions:
(define (parse-verb-phrase)
 (amb (list 'verb-phrase
            (parse-verb-phrase)
            (parse-prepositional-phrase))
      (parse-word verbs)))
we may even get infinite recursion...
