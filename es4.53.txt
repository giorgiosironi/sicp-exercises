First selected pair is 1, 20 which gives 21, it is not prime. However prime-sum-pair goes on backtracking inside itself until it produces all the pairs that are prime: <3, 20>, ...
When the prime sum pairs are exhausted and the two ambs of the two lists are empty, former fails and we have to evaluate latter.
Latter however is (amb) that always fails, so we have to backtrack and finish. 
pairs then contains the various couples of numbers satisfying the prime sum condition.
