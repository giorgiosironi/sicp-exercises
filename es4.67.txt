The frame containing the intermediate results should contain:
- variable assignments (to values or other variables/patterns)
- a list of all rules currently evaluated
However, some rules are recursive so just including an identity of the rule is going to remove power from the evaluator. So we must include a data structure containing:
- the rule
- the binding that have been made in the rule conclusion
If we find duplicates in this list in the frame, we know we are in an infinite loop and can stop.
