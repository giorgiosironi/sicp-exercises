Example: when database is traversed, we can pick up the possible rules with amb:
(define (find-assertions pattern frame)
  (let ((datum (amb . (fetch-assertions pattern frame))))
    (check-an-assertion datum pattern frame)))
There are differences in behavior, for example in case of infinite loops as each time a new abd value is produced we will get the option to terminate.
Also it's not clear to me if every new value of amb expressions will trigger new solutions. It's perfectly possible that it takes many different try-again calls to actually produce a new result as most of the values are discarded: amd values correspond loosely to frames, not solutions.
