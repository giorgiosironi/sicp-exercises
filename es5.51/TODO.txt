- extract remaining stuff from main.cpp
- remove referenced to std:: by using `use namespace std`
- Ctrl+D should not crash

ev-variable
+ implement Frame: pair of variable names (symbols?) and values
+ implement Environment: a sequence of Frames where the topmost is the one that wins and if a variable is not found it falls back to other Frames
+ implement Environment::extend()
++ Environment can return a new Environment with one more frame
++ Environment can lookup a variable in any of its frames
++ Environment starts looking up from the last frame
- implement any accessor method necessary on Frame and Environment

ev-assignment
- implement ConsMethodOperation
- test it as car
- test it as cadr with a Factory Method
- use it for assignment-variable

branch:
- implement Instruction::toString()
