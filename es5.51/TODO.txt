General refactoring:
easy:
++ lookup_register or similar in all Machine::make_*() that lookup register names
-- use cerr instead of cout for all debugging; only official print statements should use cout
--- maybe a logging function?
-- improve Environment::toString() to show values
-- since Environments always have one basic frame (if that's true), EnvironmentTest can be simplified not to create that first empty frame
-- set of assertions for checking parameters of Operations
- hard
-- Ctrl+D should not crash
-- implement == for Value
-- macros for creating ConsMethodOperation::car() and similar?
-- assertions should use raise (or even some assert construct)
-- functional tests? execute a whole program
- boring:
-- extract remaining stuff from main.cpp
-- remove referenced to std:: by using `use namespace std`
-- all methods should be camel case
-- is-operation can be operation? since it's just a string in the lookup table
- anything else
-- ask someone why idiomatic C++ is `Stack *stack` instead of `Stack* stack`

branch:
- implement Instruction::toString()

ev-lambda:
+ op lambda?
+ op lambda-parameters 
+ op lambda-body 
+ op make-procedure
