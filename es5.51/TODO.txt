- perform has to have access to:
    (define (make-perform inst machine labels operations pc)

- extract remaining stuff from main.cpp
- make lists display as list instead of (a . (b . NIL))

When the current instruction works:
- go to next instruction
- need to implement class `PromptForInput: public Operation`
- also a way to pass arguments to operations
