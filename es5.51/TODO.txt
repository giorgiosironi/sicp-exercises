Support:
- '(1 2) should be a quoted list
- (+) should be 0, (*) should be 1 and so on (arbitrary number of elements)

General refactoring:
easy:
-- improve Environment::toString() to show some values?
-- since Environments always have one basic frame (if that's true), EnvironmentTest can be simplified not to create that first empty frame
-- List::from_vector()
- hard
-- Read's parser is fairly limited as it fails on many quoted expressions
- boring:
-- extract remaining stuff from main.cpp
-- remove referenced to std:: by using `use namespace std`

- postponed
-- macros for creating ConsMethodOperation::car() and similar?
-- shared_ptr, make_shared
-- unique_ptr: slightly better, if it's possible; make_unique
-- ask someone why idiomatic C++ is `Stack *stack` instead of `Stack* stack`
