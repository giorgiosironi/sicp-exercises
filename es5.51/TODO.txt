General refactoring:
easy:
-- improve Environment::toString() to show values
-- since Environments always have one basic frame (if that's true), EnvironmentTest can be simplified not to create that first empty frame
- hard
-- Ctrl+D should not crash
-- macros for creating ConsMethodOperation::car() and similar?
-- shared_ptr, make_shared
-- unique_ptr: slightly better, if it's possible; make_unique
- boring:
-- extract remaining stuff from main.cpp
-- remove referenced to std:: by using `use namespace std`
- anything else
-- ask someone why idiomatic C++ is `Stack *stack` instead of `Stack* stack`
